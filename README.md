# TOP Library Project

### Description
This is a project from 'The Odin Project' curriculum. The main purpose of it is to demonstrate and understand of javascript objects.

### Use of Objects
The project contains 2 objects, 'Book' and 'Library'.  

- The 'Book' object is setup as a construtor function and contains all props related to a Book.  The functions are added to the prototype as that is best practice.

- The 'Library' Object is setup as a project literal since there will only ever be a single instance of it.  It contains all needed functions for managing the books in the library.  The idea is that it shouldn't be needed to call any functions directly on book objects, but it is all managed through the library object.
